## Settings 

* Slower / Faster - speeds up the creation of objects, the speed of their movement
* Less squares / More squares - allows you to create more squares in one click
* Single color / Multi color - allows you to change the color when creating and when rippling
* Random / Decrease / Increase / No change - Square size mode. The larger the square, the closer it is to the drawing. Also, in the Reduce mode, creation always starts with a large square and stops on a small one for convenience.
* Change Background / Thanks - changes the background color
* Pulse / Don't - squares with a certain probability begin to pulsate, changing their color
* Wipe / Do Not Wipe - the background stops rubbing, which allows old objects to be still on the field
* Reversal - inverts the coordinates, the front is now behind and the rear is in front
* Hook / Restrict - assigns coordinates by a small module, then allows them to gather in a grid
* Limit / Endless - all blocks that fly away immediately come back from the other side
* Mode - Pkm If there is a U-turn, then the objects are either attracted or repelled from the mouse. If it is smaller, then the objects are all repelled from the center of the screen relative to the position of the mouse
* Smaller - processes shadows, makes the creation of objects more dense.
